!!! THIS IS MATH, NOT HASKELL !!!

Within the range of natural numbers [1,10] why are there 3 multiples of 3? 

x,y,z in N
Within [x,y], given x<y, how many multiples of z are there? 

Ex: 
Given x=0,y=10,z=3
In haskell - [1,2..10]
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
Answer: 3

---- Given that x == 0: 
floor(y/z)

---- General solution: 
floor( (y-x) /z)
